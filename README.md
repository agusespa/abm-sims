# Agent-Based Model Simulations

This repository contains a collection of agent-based model (ABM) simulations. Each simulation is a self-contained project within this repository.

## Simulations

### [Mars Laboratory Emergency Response ABM](./mars_abm/README.md)

Simulates robot coordination and recruitment behaviors in highest stakes emergency response scenarios on Mars. Explores how individual decision-making under uncertainty, combined with local communication and environmental cues, can lead to efficient collective behaviors in resource acquisition and problem-solving.
Its objective is to identify the minimun fleet of robot to deploy to a permanent mission to Mars.
